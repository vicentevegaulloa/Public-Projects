# Hangman Desktop Game

This project is a little Hangman game I developed for the course Advanced Programming at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. It was a success considering I had just 2 hours to develop it and got the highest score posible ( 100 / 100).

The  objective of this project was to evaluate the students Python and PyQt5 skills. It is just a simple Hangman game where the player can select a letter, see if it suits the word or if the alien loses a bodypart.

Through this little piece of software I demonstarted:
- Python skills
- PyQt5 knowledge
- PEP8 format, etc.

Understanding the Repo:
- images: Folder with necessary images for the game
- .keep
- DCColgado.py: Game Back End
- README.md
- Ventana.py: Game Front End
- hangman.png
- main.py: RUN THIS FILE TO PLAY THE GAME.
- palabras.csv: words needed for the game.
